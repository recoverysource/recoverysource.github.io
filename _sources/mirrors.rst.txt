Courtesy Mirrors
================

`Courtesy Mirrors`_ provide a simple way to back up projects/repositories that
fall within our scope (twelfth-step) of work. This is expected to primarily serve
anyone running a static-generated website (such as :ref:`AA Mod<aamod-about>`).

Rules:

  - Mirrored repositories are only intended to serve as a backup
  - All features (except Repository) will be disabled
  - Absolutely **NO** roll-back unless the original issue has been resolved
  - Troubleshooting is not provided; only a rollback *after* the issue is resolved
  - Excessive rewrites (force pushes) will be indefinitely disabled

All repository clone requests that meet the above will be accepted. `Courtesy
Mirrors`_ are currently hosted with Gitlab; this is subject to change with
minimal notice.
